# Jeopardy

A real-time, multiplayer Jeopardy game built with [RedwoodSDK](https://rwsdk.com), demonstrating a more involved use case for `useSyncedState` backed by Cloudflare Durable Objects.

## Overview

Multiple contestants connect to a shared game session from separate devices. State is synchronized in real-time across all connected clients via WebSocket — no polling, no manual sync logic.

There are three roles:

- **Host** — controls game flow, judges responses, and manages contestants
- **Display** — a dedicated screen showing the board and clues (think: the TV in the room)
- **Contestant** — selects clues on their turn and buzzes in to respond

## How It Works

All shared game state (`connections`, `selectedClue`, `gamePhase`, `buzzerQueue`) lives in `useSyncedState` keys. When any client updates a value, all connected clients see the change immediately.

This project is intended to showcase how `useSyncedState` can coordinate complex multi-client interactions — role assignment, turn management, buzzer logic — without any custom WebSocket handling or server-side orchestration code.

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
echo "SESSION_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .dev.vars
pnpm dev
```

Navigate to `/game/:gameId` from multiple devices or browser tabs. One participant should select the **Host** role to start the game.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. If you're familiar with RedwoodSDK and want to extend the game (scoring, multiple rounds, custom clue sets, etc.) please open an issue or PR.

## Visual Tests

Component tests use Playwright CT. Snapshot images are stored in Git and must be generated on Linux to match the CI container. Run the following to update snapshots locally:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/work/ \
  -v /work/node_modules \
  -w /work/ \
  -e NODE_AUTH_TOKEN=${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN} \
  -e CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN} \
  mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.63.0-noble \
  /bin/sh -c "npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install && pnpm playwright-ct:update"
```

Then commit the updated snapshots alongside your changes.
